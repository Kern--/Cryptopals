I'm aware that this package name is pretty bad.

utils is good for primitives that can be used to build actual crypto attacks, but I'd like a separate place to put my attack implmentations.

Since golang has a crypto package already, I've opted for krypto, which I'm thinking of as shorthand for "Kern's Crypto"
